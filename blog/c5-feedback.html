    <p>Growth Mindset is believeing that learning and doing really is all about the process.  There is no perfect anything.  We strive to learn and improve.  We strive to always push ourselves to do better, to be better.
    </p>

    <p>As we learn together and even beyond our experience here in DBC, it is important that we both reflect and constantly challenge us to do improve our weaknesses.
    </p>
<h3>Feedback is ESSENTIAL to Growing </h3>
    <p>1.  It helps me to reflect on my pairing sessions. Beyond the code, and the interaction--how did it go?  Did I feel valued? Did I value the other person and their ideas?  Was it productive and positive interaction? What made it that way?
</p>
<p>
    2.  I can reflect on how I felt pairing with my partner.  I think about what my partner did that made them a great partner and what could have gone better. By giving them feedback I can then internalize the feedback in my behavior.  What I appreciated as a partner, I can try and mimick as I partner with others.
    </p>

    <p> 3.  I can receive feedback from someone else.  I can reflect on how I think I did, but haveing another perspective is helpful.  Maybe what I was trying to do was not clear.  Maybe my communication was confusing.  I can personally reflect on my intention, but a partner can give me feedback on the execution.
</p>

<p> Overall, pairing has been a great experience.  I have learned so much from others and enjoyed the experience of working through confusions together.  My coding skills has definitely has improved.  As part of growth mindset we strive to better our technical skills, but also understand that our cultural skills in working with others can help or hinder our technical skill development and thus is just as important. Plus, it's just more fun.
