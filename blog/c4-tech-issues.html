    <p>I don't think anyone would be surprised to hear there is a gender gap in the STEM fields.  I never really understood the "feminist" movement until last year.  Then I realized, I didn't have to understand it because so much progress has already been made for me.  The experience I went through was eye-opening to say the least.  I will also say that I have heard about the gender gap in the STEM fields and spent time researching and asking programmers (female and male) their thoughts and experiences.
    </p>

    <p>Now, it is clear through data there is a gap.  Every programmer that I spoke with didn't see it as a reason to stay away.  The female programmers enjoyed their fields and have moved up to more management positions with higher pay.  These anecdotes are important, but still the data makes you wonder.

    <p>Change is slow.  It always has been and always will be.  It takes time to change attitudes and philosophies.  After reading article after article on pay, job opportunities, challenges of taking maternity leave, and sexual harassment---I come away thinking this: we (I am grouping all us women together) shouldn't even try to enter the door because we may have more obstacles than men.  How will we ever create change if we don't try?

    </p>
<p> I will also remember the success stories of the female programmers I know.  They did it. </p>
