      Oh, what a week! It would take me quite a while to summarize what I have learned this week so I will focus on just a few topics.
    </p>
    <p>
       First up version control.  Version control allows many cooks in the kitchen or developers at the table.  By branching off from a common file (that remains clean), many people can focus on their work without affecting what other people are doing simultaneously.  Then once you are ready and everything is double-checked it can all be merged back together.
    </p>
    <p>
        Version control also gives you the power the go back and see the changes you made to help you understand the process or to revert back to a previous version. Git is one example of version control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through your command line, you can use git to create branches of your work that you can then “commit”/save and then merge back.  The branches help keep your “master”/original clean as you work on code in your branches.
</p>
<p>
        You can store all your code online at GitHub. With potentially many people working on something on their own computer, GitHub is the website where the master can be stored and later all edited versions merged back together into one final product.
