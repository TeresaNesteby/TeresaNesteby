    <p>Stereotype Threat is not only being aware of the way others do and will view you including their expectations for you based on your class, race, gender, etc. but the fear of and actually fulfilling those expectations. The threat of perpetuating the negative assumptions that people make either consciously or unconsciously.
    </p>

    <p>As an educator that has spent their entire career in diverse school districts working mainly with students of whom society has placed very different standards than they have on me. I have had countless conversations with students on this very topic.  I can speak to my experiences as female in the world, but I'm an educated, white female in the United States.  Their stories are far more extreme and have helped me to better understand not only myself but the world and culture in which we live.
    </p>
<p>As I transition from a field that is predominately white, female (me) to a field where I will most likely be in the minority it is important to think about how preconceived notions may affect so many aspects of my career.  I think that may be the most important piece.  I think oftentimes, people are not aware of these preconcived thoughts.  It is important to have couragous conversations.
    <p>As I move into a world that may open me up to more negative stereotypes than I am used to, I hope to stay focused on the positives.  Change does not happen overtime.  I like all of my other classmates coming from a variety of backgrounds all have our own unique perspective that together makes us a stronger team, a stronger field. Being the voice that may not always be heard, is important. We all make mistakes, we are all growing. We all must put ourselves out there to be heard even if we feel no one is listening in that moment. Chances are, they are.
