    <p> After browsing through the list of values and reflecting on times in my life when I have been at my happiest, I have come up with a list of characteristics of that time that relate back to my values.
    </p>
<p> Tranquility:  Tranquility and balance is very important to me.  On a daily basis I do try to find moments to step back and reflect. That could be through running, going for a drive, or just sitting still for a moment to breath.  I try to avoid places or situations that disrupt this tranquility with arguments and negative thoughts.
    </p>

    <p> Will-Power: Will-power is a value that I think is very important.  It is a way to push ourselves to go beyond what is momentarily comfortable.  I try to do this in running.  I try to do this in terms of studying (and switching careers).  To me, I associate will-power with grit.  The power to work through something even when challenged over and over again.

    </p>
<p> Close Relationships: What is life without close relationships? I think they keep us honest, they keep us on track, they keep from only thinking about ourselves.  I try to take time to connect with those that are around me.  It is a challenging balance though as life gets busy and I have so much to do in so little time.  In the end though, it is worth it.
  <p>  The last topic that a friend asked advice on was on tranquility and close relationships.  Sometimes there are situations that can turn toxic.  Relationships evolve.  How do we deal with that?  I think it is important to remember we are only in control of ourselves.  We strive to do better and be better, but other people are on different journies with different priorities.  We can strive for tranquility and peace with others, but there are times when maintaining that close relationships is harmful.
