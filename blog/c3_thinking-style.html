    <h2> The Concrete Sequential Thinker
    <p> I took the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> Gregorc Thinking Inventory </a> to see how I think and learn best. My top scoring category was Concrete Sequential.  I have done this type of inventory in the past, but everytime it amazes me to read the description and realize that they are describing me perfectly.
    </p>

    <p>Concrete Sequential thinkers like an orderly, quiet environment to work.  So true.  They also like clear directions, examples, and expectations.  Also true.  I feel comfort in knowing where I am and where I want to go.  They will clean off their desk before beginning work.  Scary true.  They see things in part.  I have always been better at the details.  In my job I have found I work very well paired with picture people.  They are able to envision the end goal and I could set up the plan to make it happen.  I am stronger at setting up the plan and moving along step-by-step than coming up with the bigger theoretical picture.
    </p>

    <p>Understanding the way I think and learn I have developed strategies to be successful.  I take lots of notes.  I organize my notes.  I rewrite my notes to help me see the sequence and relationships.  I make lists for myself-breaking down what I need to accomplish into smaller bits so that I can have more check-in points.
    </p>

    <p> So far my biggest struggle in DevBootcamp  has been time-management.  Working full-time and plus the demands of this program has been overwhelming at times.  I worry that other aspects of my life get ignored as I focus solely on my to-do list and completing all the tasks I need to on a given day to stay on the schedule I want.  I think this in part is due to my need to have structure and complete something before moving on to something else.  What I would like to do as I move forward is making sure I am putting other things on my to-do list that are just important--grocery shopping and cooking healthy meals, exercises, etc. Hopefully, then I will be able to better balance all the demands.  </p>

<p>  I am far from perfect at finding balance.  It is a perfect example of growth mindset.  We are always evolving and hopefully improving as human beings.  And although we may all learn best in different ways, we are all capable of learning and growing. The biggest obstacle for any learner is understanding that no one is perfect.  The first step usually is the hardest.  It is often the most intimidating.  You realize how much you don't know.  The point of learning  though is not about reaching the goal and being done. It is about the process.  It is about seeing that end goal that may seem so far off and steadily working towards it.  It is about persistence.  It is about learning for the sake of learning.
