        Right off the bat, DevBootcamp is a completely different learning experience than what I am used to. I appreciate the focus on helping us students take control of our learning.

        I am a person that values structure and a clear plan. With DevBootcamp I don't know where I will be or what I will be learning exactly at every moment.  In a way that is good for me.  It is challenging for me as I want to plan everything and know exactly what it will be like.  Learning just isn't quite that simple.  Actually that is what makes it so beautiful.  As a teacher I know that. As a student it is harder.  Ultimately, it is up to us to come in and hold on to the desire to conquer this new (to us) world. It is up to us (with the guidance of our wonderful instructors and each other) to seek out knowledge and run with it which will help us even beyond our weeks together.

      I look forward to the learning, the challenges, collaboration and community.
