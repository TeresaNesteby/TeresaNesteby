  <h1>CSS and all that JAZZ- Understanding the Box Model</h1>

    <p>In CSS there are ways to format things to create exactly what you are envisioning.  It is helpful to visualize the box model and its 4 parts.
    </p>
<ol>
  <li>Content Area: In my mind it is helpful for me to compare this to a text box in Microsoft.  This is where you would type your content or words. </li>
  <li>Padding: This is the layer just around the content. This can affect how closely the border is to your content/text. </li>
  <li>Border: This is exactly what you think it would be-a border.  It can be added or not.  It can be on one side or all sides.  This is the line between the padding and the margins.</li>
  <li>Margins: I also think back to my experience with document margins in Microsoft Word.  The margin is the area between the border and other elements. </li>
</ol>

<p> Understanding the box model and how to adjust/create the elements you want help you to better and more efficently style your page. </p>
