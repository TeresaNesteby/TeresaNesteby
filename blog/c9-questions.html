    <p>Questions are a far more important than people realize.  They help us to identify misunderstandings to strengthen our depth of knowledge (to be able to articulate what we know), plus there is a social community connection that is developed when we feel the environment is safe for us to expose what we don't know (what we may feel are our weaknesses) and in return are supported by each other.
    </p>

    <p>What is a good question? As a teacher I would say there are no bad questions. In truth, what I think is meant by that is, speak your mind, speak your current status. We are all here to support you. If questions are not properly identified or communicated there may take a bit of work in discussing to find the root of it. Your question can show what you do not know
    </p>
    <p> To formulate a quality question you must first think about what is the root/basic information that you either want others to understand or that you are confused on.  Then build from there. It makes me think about the feedback that we give being focused on something specific, actionable, and kind.  I think questions should be the same. Specific and not too broad, applied immediately somehow, and kind in nature.  We are all humans learning together.

    <p> Over the past few weeks, I have spent A LOT of timing looking at questions on StackOverflow and other websites.  The questions that I have appreciated and really been able to learn from are those that follow these rules:

      <li> Question Title: that clearly defines what you are going to ask about. </li>
      <li> Context: What background knowledge would a reader/answer-er need to fully understand the question? </li>
      <li> Problem Statement: Like a topic sentence-BE SPECIFIC AND CONCISE! </li>
      <li> Sample Code and Data: Where is the problem? What is happening when you want something else to happen? SHOW the problem. </li>
      <li> Spelling, Grammar, and Formatting!: As an English teacher---this one is a must! Proofread.  If you don't take the time to formulate your thoughts and proofread, why should I take the time to read? </li>
      <li> General Etiquette: Be polite! You do not need to add greetings/signoffs. Check back and take responses as help --not someone attacking you! </li>
    </ol>
