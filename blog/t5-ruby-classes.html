    <p>Maybe it is to literal, but in my teacher mind the perfect example of Class is actually a class, a class of students.
    </p>

    <p>If I were to describe my classroom I could call it MsNestebysClass. In that class I have students. There are certain things that all students in my class share, besides having me a teacher, they study the same subjects, are the same age to name a few. Yet in each instance of the class they are slightly different.  They speak different languages, they come from different countries, they have been in the United States different amounts of time, for example.
    </p>

    <p><pre><code>class MsNestebysClass
      def initialize(name, home_language, country_of_birth)
       @name = name
       @home_language = home_language
       @country_of_birth = country_of_birth
      end

      def introduce_student
        p "#{@name} speaks #{@home_language} and is from #{@country_of_birth}!"
        end
      end</pre></code>

    </p>
<p>  Classes are an efficient way to group objects that are similar, objects that are connected.   </p>
