    <p> Test Driven Development (TDD) is a system to create simple code that is focused on a specific purpose and more easily able to be tested/understood.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>The process begins with the driver (or programmer) deciding what the next step in their code will be.  What do they want to accomplish?  The driver then write a test for that goal.  It will of course fail the test because you have not yet written the code to accomplish that goal, but your mind now is focused clearly on your purpose. </li>
      <li> The second step is to then write as little code as you can to accomplish your goal and for it to then pass your driver test. </li>
      <li> The third and final step is to refactor your code.  Can you minimize? Is it as effecient as it can be? Does it meet all acceptable standards? </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Test Driven Development is easily used to create effecient code from scratch, but it can also be used to when working to improve and debug older code. The ideas and cycle are the same.  Each small chunk of code should have a specific purpose.  Focus on that purpose.  Create a test for it. Then work to create/edit your code to the most efficient code that will still pass your test and achieve your goal. If issues arise you are only looking at a small chunk so it is easier to focus in on the program and fix it.
