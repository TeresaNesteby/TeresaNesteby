  <h1>Enumerable Methods</h1>

    <p>Enumerable--I actually looked it up in the dictionary.  Enumerable is an adjective that means countable.
    </p>

    <p>Over the week, and through the challenges and readings I have come to understand enumerable is doing something (a method/action) a countable number of times. In Ruby, an example of enumerable is .each.  The .each method is used to perform the same task to each element in an array (doing something a countable number of times).
    </p>

    <p> There are different methods beyond .each that also are part of the Enumerable class.  Here are a few more examples of how methods in the Enumerable class work.
    </p>
    <p> .find: Using this method will pass each element through the block and returns the 1st entry that the block does not return false.

   <pre><code> Ex: numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
            numbers.find(|number| number > 5)
            #=> 6 </pre></code>

<p> .map: will take in an array and run the block(action) for each element in the array returning to you an array of the answers.</p>
  <pre><code> Ex: numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = numbers.map do |n|
    n - 1
    end

    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]
</pre></code>
