    <p>As I began JavaScript this week I was surprised how much easier I found it to learn than Ruby.  Now, I don't think JavaScript is an easier language to read than Ruby.  Ruby is very English-y. Understanding the frame, the base, as I have come to understand in Ruby after all these weeks translates.  So much in JavaScript is similar.
    </p>

    <p>With that being said, it was a week filled with syntax errors and there are some notable differences.
    </p>

    <p>Now at first glance: Ruby uses "methods" where JavaScript uses "functions."  These are the programs that essentially work as the verbs in your sentence.  They make the object do something/affect it in somehow.  Essentially, these seem to run similarly minus a few syntax differences.  JavaScript uses quite a few more ; throughout the code and define their variables (and methods) by putting "var" in front of it.  For example: var name = "Teresa" in JavaScript vs. name = "Teresa" in Ruby.  At this point I do feel that Ruby is less verbose.

    </p>
    <p> Another example I would use to compare the two is the method/fucntion to choose a random number.  In Ruby: .rand(min..max) whereas in JavaScript: rand(a, b) { return Math.floor(Math.random() * (b - a + 1) + a); } seems much wordier.
    </p>
    <p> Besides the basic syntax, I am still working to see the bigger picture.  What does using Ruby vs. using JavaScript actually mean? What are the benefits of one over the other? I hope to spend more time looking bigger picture this week.</p>
