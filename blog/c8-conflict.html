    <p>This past year I began a new position to me and it was a new position at the school I was at.  I was hired as a TOSA Literacy Specialist.  It is a great position, I was very excited about.  Basically, I was able to design the position to what I thought was best in the school that I was at.  I decided to best support literacy I would co-teach and co-plan with the Social Studies department which is heavily based in literacy. It just so happened we had a brand new teacher joining the social studies department.  I thought it would be perfect to support a new teacher and help her strengthen her curriculum to include language and literacy focused lesson plans.
    </p>

    <p>What I was not expecting was that she did not want me there.  She did not want to co-plan.  She did not want to co-teach.  She did not even want me in the room.  As someone who has been trained in coaching, I know that some teachers may feel defensive.  I was a first-year teacher at one point.  I understand when you are getting your footing, having someone there constantly may be overwhelming.
    </p>

    <p>To make a long story short, she made it very clear through passive aggressive insults at me about my teaching, about me as a person, that she did not have any respect for my abilities and did not want my help. As the more experienced teacher in more of a coaching role, it was quite challenging for me.  I knew that if I fought back insult for insult or even just defended myself I might alienate her more.  My response was then to just walk away when she insulted me or my teaching. I didn't feel as though anything I could say would make the situation any better.  She didn't want me there.

    </p>

<p> As a teacher I feel our job is to instill in our students a love for learning and a desire to always push ourselves to be better.  Learning and growing should never end.  Even though I was in a coaching role, I still see myself as a learner. I don't have all the answers.  I am still learning.  It was very challenging for me to deal with a teacher who was brand new to teaching who would openly tell me and administration that she knew everything.  She did not need or want support. That goes against everything I believe about teaching. How do I respond to that?
</p>
<p>When I think about what I was fundamentally upset about was definitely that I did not feel respected as educator.  I have dedicated myself to teaching.  I have more than enough credits for two masters degrees in education.  I have taught in a variety of settings.  It was like all my work was for nothing. I felt my time, my knowledge was not valued. I have thought quite a bit about how to make the situation better.  How would I do it differently? Should I stand up for myself and risk making it worse or just ignore it and hope it gets better?
</p>
<p>  In the end, I think I should have valued my time and my knowledge by changing my schedule and moving on to a situation in which I could have an impact.  Some situations are not worth the drama.  By moving on to a situation where I could have been helpful, she might have seen how I could support her and that I wasn't there to critique her and possibly would have been more open to support.  I am one to avoid conflict. To walk away.  I think in some situations it is okay to just walk away. You can't control other people only yourself.
