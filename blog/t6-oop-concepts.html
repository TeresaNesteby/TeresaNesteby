    <p>Writing code in Ruby is all about understanding the pieces (objects) and how they work together. One aspect of that is understanding variable scope.  Now variable we may all be familiar with from high school algebra class, but scope is a less commonly used term.  It refers to where you can access or use the variable.
    </p>

    <p>In Ruby there are multiple variable scope types. Generally speaking, you can identify what type of scope a variable has by the first character in its name:
    </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th> Variable Type </th>
   <th> Accessible From... </th>
    <th> First Character in Name </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Global Variable </td>
    <td> Accessible anywhere in Ruby </td>
    <td> $ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Class Variable </td>
    <td> Accessible within any instance of that class </td>
    <td> @@ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Instance Variable </td>
    <td> Similar to Class Variables but only accessible withint that specific instance of the Class </td>
    <td> @ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Constance Variable </td>
    <td> If declared within a class or module they are accessible from  anywhere within that class or module. If declared  outside of a class or module, they are accessible from anywhere (similar to global scope) </td>
    <td> Variable name in all CAPS </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Local Variable </td>
    <td>Accessible only in whatever they were declared in (a single method, single loop, etc.)
    </td>
    <td> Variable name in lowercase with underscore (_) if necessary </td>
  </tr>
</table>
    <p>If you are unsure what the scope of the variable you are working with is and it is not identifiable by the first character in the name of that variable, you can also call the defined? method on that variable.

    </p>
    <p> For example, "variable.defined?" and a possible output would be "global-variable."

      <p>  Understanding scope is helpful in both reading and writing code.  You want balance your need to protect your variables by not giving them too much accessibility beyond where you need them yet you want to be able to use them when needed.  It is a balance.  Begin by understanding what your variable represents and thinking about how that will be used in your code.
